I have enjoyed coding/programming since I was younger through platforms as Scratch before beginning to learn common languages such as Python, and JavaScript. Originally, I was in awe of robots and other electronic toys and devices and how they worked which wanted me to learn more. I do lessons on coding outside of schooling as well as software and other technology orientated subjects within school. I wanted to further my knowledge in the IT field before I stepped outside of school as so I have a general idea of what the field was like and I researched about courses I could do, and I decided on this course as it has general information about the IT field while also being on the shorter length which minimises it's impact on my schooling. I expect to learn more about the IT field and what is expected of IT technicians within the field.</P>
